# June 22nd/23rd Awful Sleep Schedule

My friend Eddy Zhao showed me a great tutorial on making a PCB Business Card, which inspired me to try it out.

I initially tried to export all of the parts to a KiCAD library, but I could not find the footprints for the resistor and LEDs, so I continued with EasyEDA.

Here is the schematic. I made it very similar, but I just added one extra LED

I started experimenting with the colors by using the top layer and top soldermask layer as seen below.

Unfortunately, it felt kinda empty, so I started shifting things around and adding more.

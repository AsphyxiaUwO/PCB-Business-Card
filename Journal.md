# June 22nd/23rd Awful Sleep Schedule

My friend Eddy Zhao showed me a great tutorial on making a PCB Business Card, which inspired me to try it out.

I initially tried to export all of the parts to a KiCAD library, but I could not find the footprints for the resistor and LEDs, so I continued with EasyEDA.

Here is the schematic. I made it very similar, but I just added one extra LED

I added SVGs of email, GitHub, and LinkedIn to make the PCB look a bit more aesthetically pleasing with my contact info.

Unfortunately, it felt kinda empty, so I started using the soldermask layer to add some color around

Added braille with the copper layer, but I have no idea if it would work.

I don't have a job, so I just put down that I am a student.

And I put down a few things I do

Found rounded edges

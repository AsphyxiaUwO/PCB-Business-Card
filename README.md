# PCB-Business-Card
This project is a business card comprised of a PCB with an NFC tag and two LEDs.

I wanted to have a good first impression with a lot of hack clubbers since this would be my first time heading to a hackathon, so noting down some things I am better at would help a bit. Additionally, I felt more lacking in my PCB skills than my CAD, so this seemed like another project to just get better antiquated with PCB software.
